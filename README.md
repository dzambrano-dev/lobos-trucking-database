# Lobos Trucking Database System

## Overview
This project is a small internal database system designed to help a local trucking company track jobs, invoices, and operational records. The goal was to replace ad-hoc spreadsheets with a more structured and reliable data system.

## Problem
The company previously relied on manual record keeping and spreadsheets, which made it difficult to:
- Track completed jobs
- Manage invoices consistently
- Avoid data duplication and errors
- Maintain organized historical records

## Solution
I designed a database-backed system to organize trucking jobs and invoices in a structured way. The system enforces consistent data entry and allows records to be queried and reviewed more reliably than spreadsheets.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL / SQLite / PostgreSQL — whichever you used)
- [Language if applicable: Python / C++ / etc.]
- Local development environment

## Security & Data Considerations
- Sensitive business data was anonymized before public sharing
- Access to the database was limited to authorized users
- Structured schemas reduce accidental data corruption

## What I Learned
- Designing schemas around real operational workflows
- Translating business needs into technical structure
- The importance of data integrity and access control
- How small systems still require careful handling of sensitive data

## Future Improvements
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
- Automated backups
- Input validation and error handling
